# Wireframes / storyboards
Originally my project encompassed a broad spectrum of the EV market, including economics, policy, and environmental impacts. However, I realized that this wide scope only allowed me to superficially touch upon each topic. By narrowing my focus to the environmental cost of EV production, I'm able to delve deeper into this critical issue and provide more insightful analysis. This focused approach uncovers a unique perspective that's often overlooked in public discourse. Conversations about EVs typically center on their operational benefits, but the environmental impacts of their production, especially the ethical and ecological challenges in sourcing battery materials, receive less attention. My project seeks to fill this gap, challenging common perceptions and adding significant value to the conversation.

To effectively communicate these complex issues, I plan to incorporate innovative data visualizations and heat maps into my presentation. Data visualizations will present statistics on the environmental impact of EV production, such as the carbon footprint of manufacturing an EV versus a traditional vehicle, in a clear and engaging manner. I plan to use heat maps to visually represent regions most impacted by the mining of materials for electric vehicles. These maps will show the intensity of environmental damage or resource depletion in certain areas. These visual tools will not only make the information more accessible but also more impactful, enabling my audience to visually grasp the scale and seriousness of these environmental concerns. It's important to note that the data displayed is fictional and solely intended for explanatory purposes in the project.

This focus is not only timely but also aligns perfectly with current concerns about sustainable practices and ethical sourcing in manufacturing. It engages my target audience more effectively, including those interested in sustainability, ethics in manufacturing, and the future of green technologies. By honing in on this specific aspect, my research becomes more manageable and structured, allowing for a focused exploration of case studies, expert interviews, and environmental reports.

# User research 

## Target audience
I am targeting a diverse group of individuals to ensure a broad spectrum of perspectives. This includes people from various age groups, with different educational backgrounds, and from multiple geographic locations. My aim is to include not only those who are highly informed and interested in electric vehicles (EVs) but also individuals with limited knowledge on the subject, to understand the range of awareness and opinions. Key stakeholders like current EV owners, potential buyers, environmental activists, automotive industry workers, and policymakers are crucial to my study. The primary audience for my project's findings will be individuals interested in environmental issues, sustainability, and technology. Additionally, the insights I gather will be invaluable for secondary audiences, including policymakers, professionals in the automotive industry, and educators, who can influence broader discussions and decisions related to EVs and their environmental impact.

## Interview script
| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Understand the public's perception of the environmental impact of EVs.|What is your current perception of electric vehicles in terms of environmental friendliness?|
|Gauge awareness about the materials and processes involved in EV production.|Were you aware of the environmental impacts associated with the production of EVs, especially concerning battery materials?|
|Identify potential shifts in opinion or behavior based on this information.|How does this information about the production impact influence your opinion or potential decision to purchase an EV?|

## Interview findings
| Questions               | Interview 1 (35-year-old EV owner) | Interview 2 (25-year-old environmental activist) | Interview 3 (19-year-old potential EV buyer) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|What is your current perception of electric vehicles in terms of environmental friendliness?|Believed EVs were completely environmentally friendly.|Had some knowledge about the environmental impacts of EV production.|Initially thought EVs were the best option for reducing carbon footprint.|
|Were you aware of the environmental impacts associated with the production of EVs, especially concerning battery materials?|Wasn't fully aware of the environmental costs of battery production.|Expressed concern about unethical mining practices and the need for better recycling methods.|Was surprised to learn about the environmental costs of EV production.|
|How does this information about the production impact influence your opinion or potential decision to purchase an EV?|Felt conflicted but still positive about EVs, emphasizing the need for more sustainable production practices.|Suggested more government intervention to ensure ethical production processes.|Indicated a desire for more transparency from manufacturers and considered this information crucial for making a future purchase decision.|


# Identified changes for Part III
The user research conducted reveals a significant lack of awareness among the general public regarding the environmental costs associated with the production of electric vehicles (EVs), particularly in the context of battery materials. This gap in knowledge, once addressed, often leads individuals to develop a more nuanced understanding of EVs. They start recognizing the balance between the operational benefits of EVs and the drawbacks of their production. Notably, respondents expressed a strong desire for more sustainable and ethical production practices in the EV industry. This sentiment highlights a potential market opportunity for EV manufacturers who are willing to prioritize and invest in environmentally responsible and ethical production methods.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|The interviews revealed a significant gap in public knowledge about the environmental costs of EV production, especially concerning battery manufacturing.|To address the knowledge gap, Part III will include a detailed section on the environmental and ethical implications of EV battery production, using visual aids and infographics for clearer understanding.|
|Participants showed a keen interest in the ethical aspects of EV production, emphasizing the importance of sustainable and fair labor practices in the supply chain.|The project will integrate case studies or examples of companies that are leading the way in sustainable and ethical EV production practices, highlighting positive industry shifts.|
|There was a notable shift in perspective among interviewees once they were informed about the production impacts of EVs, suggesting the need for more transparent and comprehensive communication from manufacturers.|In response to the desire for more transparency, Part III will propose recommendations for EV manufacturers on how they can better communicate the environmental impacts of their vehicles to consumers.|
|The feedback highlighted a potential market opportunity for EVs that prioritize environmental and ethical considerations in their production process, indicating a consumer preference for such models.|Based on the observed market opportunity, Part III will explore the potential business models and strategies that EV manufacturers could adopt to appeal to environmentally and ethically conscious consumers.|

As I conclude my project on the environmental impacts of electric vehicle production, I realize the importance of highlighting both the challenges and opportunities stemming from the current lack of public awareness. My work has the potential to educate and shape both consumer and manufacturer perspectives. It's crucial for me to balance the environmental costs of EV production with their operational benefits, to avoid oversimplifying the narrative. The growing consumer interest in sustainable and ethical practices that I've observed indicates a trend that could influence broader industry and policy changes. Ultimately, my project is not just about providing information; it's a potential catalyst for encouraging more responsible approaches in EV production and the wider adoption of sustainable technology.
