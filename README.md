# About me
Welcome to my portfolio, crafted as part of my Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I am William "Will" Wilkinson (he/him), and I am a Fellow for the Aspen Institute and the Heinz College Tribal Affairs Fellow. My decision to enroll in this course stems from a desire to delve deeper into how data can be relayed effectively and honestly to the public, a skill I consider crucial in policy-making and community engagement. In the final year of my M.S. in Public Policy and Management, my academic and professional journey has been deeply rooted in community service and policy innovation. 

An alumnus of HBS’s Tribal Leaders Program and a graduate of Haskell Indian Nations University, an all-Native American institution, my experiences range from working alongside tribal leaders across North America to developing solutions for community improvement, to holding policy roles within institutions like the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Senate. Currently serving as a senior advisor for Chicago’s Police District Council, I blend my diverse experiences to meet the complex needs of urban communities.

# What I hope to learn
- **Data Visualization Mastery**: I'm interested in learning how to craft data illustrations efficiently for varying audiences, recognizing the importance of tailoring visualizations to resonate with different stakeholders.
- **Technical Proficiency**: With a passion for new technology, I aim to become proficient in GitHub and data modeling applications presented in this course, broadening my technical toolkit for data analysis and storytelling.
- **Predictive Analytics Skills**: I seek to enhance my predictive analytics abilities, enabling me to forecast trends and make data-driven predictions, a skill set that is increasingly vital in policy-making and strategic decision-making.

Upon completing my degree in May 2024, I intend to leverage these newly honed competencies in a role that intersects with technology, policy, or strategic consulting. My career search is broad, encompassing potential positions in government agencies, non-profit organizations, or the private sector. Regardless of the specific role I acquire, my commitment is steadfast: to utilize data in crafting stories that not only inform but also inspire change and propel societal advancement.

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
