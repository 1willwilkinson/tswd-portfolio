# About me
Welcome to my portfolio, crafted as part of my Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I am William "Will" Wilkinson (he/him), and I am a Fellow for the Aspen Institute and the Heinz College Tribal Affairs Fellow. My decision to enroll in this course stems from a desire to delve deeper into how data can be relayed effectively and honestly to the public, a skill I consider crucial in policy-making and community engagement. In the final year of my M.S. in Public Policy and Management, my academic and professional journey has been deeply rooted in community service and policy innovation. 

An alumnus of HBS’s Tribal Leaders Program and a graduate of Haskell Indian Nations University, an all-Native American institution, my experiences range from working alongside tribal leaders across North America to developing solutions for community improvement, to holding policy roles within institutions like the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Senate. Currently serving as a senior advisor for Chicago’s Police District Council, I blend my diverse experiences to meet the complex needs of urban communities.

# What I hope to learn
- **Data Visualization Mastery**: I'm interested in learning how to craft data illustrations efficiently for varying audiences, recognizing the importance of tailoring visualizations to resonate with different stakeholders.
- **Technical Proficiency**: With a passion for new technology, I aim to become proficient in GitHub and data modeling applications presented in this course, broadening my technical toolkit for data analysis and storytelling.
- **Predictive Analytics Skills**: I seek to enhance my predictive analytics abilities, enabling me to forecast trends and make data-driven predictions, a skill set that is increasingly vital in policy-making and strategic decision-making.

Upon completing my degree in May 2024, I intend to leverage these newly honed competencies in a role that intersects with technology, policy, or strategic consulting. My career search is broad, encompassing potential positions in government agencies, non-profit organizations, or the private sector. Regardless of the specific role I acquire, my commitment is steadfast: to utilize data in crafting stories that not only inform but also inspire change and propel societal advancement.
