# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
Since the completion of Part II of my project, significant changes have been implemented to enhance the impact and relevance of the content. One of the primary modifications was the narrowing down of the target audience. This focused approach allowed for a more tailored and effective communication strategy. To further engage the audience, innovative visuals were introduced, such as a word cloud at the beginning of the presentation. This word cloud effectively captures the general perception of 'Electric Vehicles (EV)' among the average person.

Additionally, a detailed breakdown of an EV battery was included, showcasing its various components. This segment smoothly transitions into an exploration of the origins of these elements, featuring a global map highlighting countries where mining for these resources occurs. The narrative was restructured to emphasize the impacts of mining on the people living in these countries. Furthermore, clear guidelines were presented to empower the audience to drive change. However, the proposed inclusion of market opportunities was ultimately excluded, as I felt it wasn't appropriate for my intended audience.

## The audience
The focus is the average citizen and those with EVs, aiming to raise awareness and understanding about the complexities and impacts of EV production. Insights from interviews and persona development played a crucial role in narrowing down and understanding the audience. This helped in making specific adjustments to the final project to ensure it resonated well with the targeted demographic. By aligning the content and visuals with the interests and concerns of the average citizen, the project aimed to be more engaging and informative, thereby increasing its potential impact.

# Final thoughts
Reflecting on the process, the project was both challenging and rewarding. The most exciting aspect was the ability to transform complex data into a narrative that was both accessible and engaging to the average person. Time constraints did limit the exploration of some areas, such as a deeper dive into the socioeconomic implications of EV production. Despite these limitations, the project was a fulfilling endeavor, providing valuable insights into EV production and its global impacts.
